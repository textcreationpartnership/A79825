         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Citi≈øens of Londons Re≈øolution, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the taking up of Arms.</head>
            <p>AT this Common Councell, Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder declared, That by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lord Major, he was to ≈øignifie to them the cau≈øe of their A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, how that his Lord≈øhip had ye≈øterday received a Letter from Sir <hi>Edward Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> one of his Maje≈øties principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, intimating that the Lord Major ≈øhould call a <hi>Common Councell,</hi> and then he ≈øhould hear further of his Maje≈øty: there was al≈øo pre≈øent in the Coun≈øell Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Lord <hi>Newburgh,</hi> who came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Maje≈øties Me≈ø≈øage or Reque≈øt to t' is Court: And thereupon the L. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> was de≈øired to come into the Court who declared and ≈øaid in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> His Maje≈øty out of his good affection in acknowledging of your
<pb facs="tcp:156779:3"/>great loves lately ≈øhewed unto His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty, hath ≈øent me in a Me≈ø≈øage unto you a≈ø≈øuring it to be the ≈øame contained in a Paper, which he pre≈øented and de≈øired to be read to this Common Councell, which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>The humble de≈øire of the Court they thought nece≈ø≈øary to pre≈øent His Maje≈øty to be graciou≈øly plea≈øed, that all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents</hi> and Cau≈øers of the≈øe Tumults, what≈øoever they be, being apprehended, may be brought into Examination, and receive condigne puni≈øhment according to the Law.</p>
            <p>And the≈øe things thus agreed upon, were by Direction of this Common-Councell here openly declared and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the mouth of Mr. Recorder, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Honourable per≈øon of the Lord <hi>Newburgh,</hi> with de≈øire that the ≈øame ≈øhould be by his Lord≈øhip accordingly pre≈øented unto his Maje≈øty, the which he promi≈øed to perform with tru≈øt.</p>
            <p>And likewi≈øe touching the great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb facs="tcp:156779:3"/>in appearance of the Trained Bands of this City to their Colours at the beat of the Drum, e≈øpecially in the≈øe times of danger, in contempt of Authority, being a matter of exceeding great con≈øequence, and not fit to be ≈øuffered. And thereupon this Common-Councell taking much to heart, that ≈øuch di≈øobedience ≈øhould grow and be found in the Inhabitants of this City, to the great di≈øre≈øpect of Magi≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and contempt of Government; And that ≈øuch di≈øorders and tumultary A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ≈øhould be permitted in ≈øuch a City as this, formerly famous for the good and quiet government therof, hath thought it very expedient and behoveful, for redre≈ø≈øe and remedy to be had in the≈øe abu≈øes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not fit to be any longer indured, that every Member of this Common-Councel now a≈ø≈øembled, ≈øhall in their ≈øeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, ≈øpread it abroad, &amp; make it known That if any per≈øon or per≈øons, ≈øhall from henceforth neglect his duty and ≈øervice to be performed, as afore≈øaid, he ≈øhall receive condign puni≈øhment, according to Law.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156779:4"/>
            <p>It is al≈øo further thought fit, and ≈øo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by the Common Coun≈øell, that the Lord Major may ≈øend out his Precepts in ≈øuch manner, and to ≈øuch purpo≈øe, as his Lord≈øhip, and his Brethren the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, ≈øhall think fit for Watch and Ward, rai≈øing of Arms, or otherwi≈øe, for the pre≈øervation of this City; to which this Court, and all the Members thereof promi≈øe all due and cheerfull Obedience.</p>
            <p>And although the troubles and di≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this City hath bin many, ≈øo that they could not re≈øt in peace, nor quiet; yet they are now re≈øolved by the help of Almighty God, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt both King and Parliament, again≈øt any forrein inva≈øion abroad, or in≈øurrection at home, and though many ≈øcandalous and ≈øcurro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ≈øpeeches hath bin ≈øpread abroad, and divulged throughout the whole Kingdom, by factious people, to the great di≈øgrace of the whole City, ≈øaving that they are Traytors again≈øt the King, intending to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Parliament, and to take Arms again≈øt him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156779:4"/>
            <p>This is fal≈øe and contrary, for neither the Honourable Court of Parliament nor the City of <hi>London</hi> never were intended to take Arms again≈øt his Royall Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty.</p>
            <p>For they are re≈øolved to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him with all their might and power, again≈øt all tho≈øe that ≈øhall offer to oppo≈øe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt him.</p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe this Court entred into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther con≈øultation and debate, touching the tumultuous A≈ø≈øemblies lately ≈øpread to the great trouble and affrightment of His Maje≈øties Subjects, and al≈øo touching the great neglect of that due re≈øpect which ought to be given by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this City, to the ≈øeverall precepts lately i≈ø≈øued out by the Lord Major, fora continuall Watch and Ward day and night, for prevention and ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch tumults and di≈øtempers.</p>
